		<h1>Proposal for Civil Protest</h1>
<p>
When: <time datetime="2011-01-17">January 17, 2012</time>
<br>
Where: Washington, DC.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
	&ldquo;...When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce 
	them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government,&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&mdash; <cite>The Declaration of Independence</cite>
</p>

<p>Our long train of abuses and usurpations include an encroaching police state.</p>

<ol>
<li> NDAA - Indefinite Detention with no trial. Congress and President Obama passed NDAA. NDAA goes against most of the bill of rights, habeas corpus, and posse comitatus.

<li> Warmongering, Endless unconstitutional, unjustified wars.
<li> Privacy and civil liberties stripped by TSA, USA PATRIOT, threatened by SOPA and Protect IP.
<li> Government debt and inflationary financing via the FED. 
</ol>

    <li>End to unconstitutional wars. Military out of Iran and Middle East immediately. These wars 
    have cost us trillions, garnered hatred and are impending a world war.
    <li>Veto SOPA and Protect IP; they are fascist, unconstitutional violations of the first Amendment. 
    <li>An audit of the FED. 
    <li>Resignation of Eric Holder, for "Fast and Furious", the anti-2nd amendment false flag.
	<li>End the Fed and institute a constitutional amendment to keep government separated from economy.
	<li>The right to determine and keep oneâ€™s own money. Silver and gold coins, as we wish.
