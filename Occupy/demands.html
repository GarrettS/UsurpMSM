		<h1>Proposal for Civil Protest</h1>
<p>
When: <time datetime="2011-01-17">January 17, 2012</time>
<br>
Where: Washington, DC.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
	&ldquo;...When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce 
	them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government,&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&mdash; <cite>The Declaration of Independence</cite>
</p>

<p>Our long train of abuses and usurpations include an encroaching police state, unjustified wars, 
government borrowing and debt increase, all paid for by the tax payers; all of funded by taxation 
without representation.</p>

<ol>
<li> NDAA - Indefinite Detention with no trial. Congress and President Obama passed NDAA. 
    NDAA goes against most of the bill of rights, habeas corpus, and posse comitatus act.

<li> Warmongering, Endless unconstitutional, unjustified wars.
<li> Privacy and civil liberties stripped by TSA, USA PATRIOT, threatened by SOPA and Protect IP.
<li> Government debt and inflationary financing via the FED. 
</ol>

 <h2>Demands</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>End to unconstitutional wars. Military out of Iran and Middle East and an end to sanctions 
    on Iran, effective immediately. These wars have cost us trillions, garnered hatred, and are 
    impending a world war.

    <li>End to military and police state: Abolish NDAA, USA PATRIOT, National Quick Response Team, 
	Civilian Inmate Labor Program, TSA. Close Guantanamo Bay and all other such detention centers (see also:

	>Internment / Resettlement Specialist (31E)</a>)

    <li>Veto SOPA and Protect IP; they are fascist, unconstitutional violations of the first Amendment. 

    <li>Resignation or recall of all senators and congressmen who voted in favor of NDAA.
	<li>Resignation or impeachment of Barack Obama as U.S. President.

    <li>An audit of the FED. 
    <li>Resignation of Eric Holder, for "Fast and Furious", the anti-2nd amendment false flag.
	<li>A plan to End the Fed and institute a constitutional amendment to keep government separated from economy.
	<li>The right to determine and keep one’s own money. Silver and gold coins, as we wish.
